  Women in HPC Taiwan Chapter, founded in 2023, is the first in East and Southeast Asia, promoting gender diversity in high-performance computing. The official website serves as an entry point for sharing event information and initiatives that support and empower women in HPC. I developed this platform to provide updates on activities and opportunities, making it easier for visitors to stay informed and engaged.
  Women in HPC Taiwan Chapter 成立於 2023 年，是東亞與東南亞的第一個 WHPC 分會，致力於推動 HPC 領域的性別多元。官方網站作為入口，提供活動資訊與相關倡議，以支持並賦權女性。此專案展現我們提升認識、促進包容，透過推廣與教育，鼓勵更多女性探索 HPC 的機會。
