  The Taiwan Biobank is a large-scale biomedical project led by Academia Sinica, collecting biological samples and health data to support researchers in advancing medical development. This project involves designing and building the official website to introduce the Taiwan Biobank’s mission, updates, and statistical data, as well as providing a platform for the public to register and participate in the program. It includes both the official website and the entry page for the data release system. The designer worked on this project while employed at the National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC).

  臺灣人體生物資料庫收整檢體與人體健康資料，提供給研究學者以促進醫療發展。本專案設計、建置官方網站，呈現臺灣人體生物資料庫理念、消息與統計資料，提供民眾報名參與計畫。包含官方網站與釋出資料系統的入口頁面，為設計者任職於國網中心時專案。
